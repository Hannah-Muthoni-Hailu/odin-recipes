    <img src="../images/shrimp.webp" alt="Shrimp meal">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This one pot Mediterranean shrimp and vegetables, colorful and full of flavor, is sure to please. Lemon, garlic, tomato, red onion, bell pepper, parsley, and spinach combine with shrimp and rice in one pot, making a Mediterranean-style dish that checks all the boxes—and the ease of cleanup doesn’t hurt a thing!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon, divided</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup yellow mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>5 large yellow or gold potatoes, peeled (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>
        <li>12 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>additional honey for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the orange juice, olive oil, mustard, honey, salt, oregano, and black pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut each peeled potato into randomly-shaped pieces about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in the bowl with orange juice mixture, toss to coat, then scoop into a large roasting pan. Spread out evenly in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in the mixing bowl and coat with remaining orange juice mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the roasting pan, setting on top of the potatoes. Pour over any remaining juice mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Check halfway through roasting and add hot water to the pan only if the potatoes are drying out; at the end of roasting there should be only juices in the pan, not too much excess water, so add only as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve with additional honey drizzled over the top of the chicken and potatoes, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
